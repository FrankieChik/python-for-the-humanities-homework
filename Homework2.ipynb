Write a loop that asks the user to enter an item. If that item exists in the dictionary add the item to a list called \"basket\". You can represent each item as a tuple (<item>, <price>). The user should be able to enter \"done\" to exit the loop. After the loop has finished, print the list of items bought, the price for each, and the total price for every thing in the basket."

    "Let's play some Black Jack. There are two players: the computer and the user. For each player create a list. Give each player a new card by generating a random number between 1 and 11 (I know this is simplified by works for this exercise) and print the number for the user. Then in a loop, ask the user \"Do you want another card?\". If the user says yes, generate another number for both players and print the number for the user. If the numbers for either player add up to 21 that player has won. Leave the loop and print who has won. If the numbers add up to more than 21, that player has lost. Leave the loop and print who has lost. Otherwise, continue with the next iteration. If the user says \"No\" to the question if they want another card, exit the loop. The player with the higher total wins. Print the winner."
